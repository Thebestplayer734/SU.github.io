  <h1>Market Thoughts</h1>
  <p>
     <br><br><strong>21 July 2025:</strong>So Far, I've set up a dashboard which I update weekly on Sundays that plots high impact fundamental data releases of various US econoomic metrics including: ISM Manufacturing/Services Purchasing Managers 
      Index, CPI, Unemployment Data, Retail Sales, the 3 different cuts of GDP releases, Housing Data and the Trade Balance. Here comes my first idea: got to look at how the FED is shaping up in the long run (Long Run value) with respect to their
      monetary policy and then using orderflow tools (Short Run value) to enter into bets scaled according to how confident I am with the respective position im taking. This has been the idea that sort of got me hooked. It could yield very high returns with 
      the leverage I have access to (1:30). However, due to my warchest being a bit empty, my starting capital looks like it will be ~$440. This is okay tho because if im trading $1 pts on S&P500 CFD's I only need about ~$300 for one contract and I think
      that will be enough to simulate realistic enough trading conditions. Also less capital means loss's will be minimal. So $440 is enough Just until I understand things a bit better. But enough of that, time to do the research.
      
     <br> <br> <strong>21 July 2025:</strong> Its almost time now to get back into the markets, I've already done some analysis
      over my coursework at uni, very rudumentary though I have to say. Mainly just watching how the market incorporates new
      information, the way price behaves at critical levels (VWAP/VPOC/SD Bands etc.), some theory on how traders measure their performance, the
      price ladder, my understanding of economics and finance and a touch of ChatGPT (hahahah cant avoid it nowadays, too good at coding). There were some big wins... however I sort of burnt out due to a series 
      of unfortunate events... but Im back for good now. Now this will either go very good and I become a legend, or end as a cautionary tale of the dangers
      of gambling and lost time that I tell colleagues in the future. Whatever it is, I hope I look back one day and appreciate myself for trying something. 

      <br> <br> I've thought about it more clearly now and have decided to share the critical points of my strategy due to my understanding of 
      the fact that this is not a perfectly replicable strategy sent from god (Otherwise i'd sell it for millions), however also knowing its strength if done right. Please note though, it may be equally destructive when done incorrectly and should only be attempted if
      a person has lots of spare time, a healthy mental state and an okay understanding of econ/finance/statistics (pretty much upto the applications of hypo-testing to begin but will need to learn as time passes and stay upto date with advancements). The core idea is 
      to look at how the FED is shaping up in the long run with respect to their monetary policy and then using
      orderflow tools (Short Run value) to scale into bets weighted proportionally to how confident I am with each given position at different points in time.
      I believe there is very real possibility to generate abnormal returns if a quantitative system is made and updated 
      by someone with a good understanding of this stuff to inform that persons day-to-day trading decisions. The key is simply to understand
      everything that matters, how much it matters, what may change that mattering, the effects of any given change and finally reviewing news daily
      so as to update positions with respect to my thoughts. Now it seems complicated but I believe that if I can 
      organise these things, probs diagramatically, after just a few months of practice, depravity commitment, it should just be second nature. 
      But What are these things you may ask? Well its everything isn't it; who is participating, supply/demand of goods/services, elasticity's of 
      various entities, market structure and competition, the integration of markets, trade flows and exchange rates,
      expectations and behaviour, policy and regulation, external shocks like: natural/man-made disasters or technological change, energy prices, orderflow, 
      market micro-structure, curerncy effects, demographics and cultural/sociopolitical factors. Basically everything
      that can affect price can be traced back to some combination of the topics found in these broader factors of econ/finance which I just listed. 
      This is what my research will be based on. This seems to be a sensible approach given what I know about the lack of abnormal returns in financial markets and staggerring loss rate of the retail trading community.
      
      <br> <br>Well after that little intro, I got some things to do for the next couple days but will be back to make a real start :).
      
      <br> <br> <strong>21 July 2025:</strong>This post marks the exciting beginning to my work in financial data analysis - with equal parts
      optimism and foreboding. Let's see how we do. :)
