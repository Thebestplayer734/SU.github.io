  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As mentioned I am Suhaas Utagi, basically I was born in Bengaluru, India in 2003 to a nice Hindu family. After dedicating
    his life to bettering his family's living situation, my father, Shrishial Utagi, made the fateful decision to move to Perth,
    Western Australia. I spent my early childhood at Comet Bay Primary School where I did many random things. My mother, Bharathi,
    raised me and my elder brother Susheel (4yrs older) as vegetarians and would cook us the best food everyday. Honestly, she's 
    likely the reason i didnt die of malnutrition, if it were up to me I probably would of eaten junk-food and played games/
    watched movies 24/7. No responsibility, good friends, a park and some bushes next to my house and a conciousness. It was a nice time. I think it was sometime after 
    a big week at school around yr 4/5 when I was watching the Big Bang Theory with all my family where I think my life peaked. 
    I dont know why I liked that memory so much, probably just reflects how the best things in life are usually so simple. That show
    really did make me value education alot more which aligned with my parents plan, I liked Raj and Howard too hahaha. 
    It was around here, maybe a bit earlier, where I found a passion for academia. I knew there were so many things to do in 
    the world but wasn't sure where I would fit in. I just knew that I was okay at maths and was intrigued by astronomy and 
    the scince of our universe. I spent a great amount of time looking at constellations, doing math, watching horror movies and playing
    games, mostly watching them on youtube though because I never wanted to pay for them, like those 10hr Full Game Movie videos
    that just go over the whole story of a game if you know what i mean. Some of my favourites I remember were The Last of Us, 
    The Walking Dead - a TellTale game, the shockingly intense story of Five nights at Freddy, The Matrix, Assassins Creed Black Flag, Until Dawn
    Fallout 4 and GTA V. I also liked all of the Harry-Potter movies, Pirates of the Caribbean, Adventure Time, Intersteller, Avatar:TLAB,
    HunterXHunter, etc. but I could never list them all there were so many hahaha. I always thought about how lucky it was to be born pretty
    much just as all these developments in technology were being made. These activities coupled with school filled up my days
    on repeat through out my teenage years, I was having a good time but just felt like I should of been doing something else with
    my life. I wouldnt find what it was until just a few days before my writing this post.

    Proceeding Highschool I found out about my fathers efforts in 'beating the market' and quickly learnt just how outmatched the
    typical 'retail day-trader' was compared to the algorithems and institutions. As I had taken Econ as an elective in Yr 11/12, I had
    had an idea about how things worked, but was too cooked to really piece it all together. I realized how invested my dad was, 
    due to working in oil & gas for so long, my dad was looking for a way out just like so many. He too spent many hours and money studying 
    fibonnacci sequences, candlestick-patterns and other various forms of 'technical analysis' from trading guru's online, but his 
    efforts were futile. This got me pretty depressed for a long time as I had just studied the idea of opportunity cost and 
    the gears started turning in my head. I just saw the immense deadweight loss created by this 'fraudulent trading guru' industry I was 
    watching destroy my dad's capital. I couldn't convince him of how pointless these approaches were despite citing
    research papers on efficient market hypothesis and the lack of evidence for abnormal returns among hedge funds among a few of the other theories
    I began studying at university, but he didnt think I was smart enough hahaha. Fair enough though, my parents are really from a different world.
    Where they're from experience is above everything but at some point he realised I wasn't going to let this down and so around the age of 18 my dad 
    gifted me a special present. A trading course. I studied it and was positively surprised. It was the first one that didnt seem like
    complete lies from what I was studying. I'd still say that the course was overpriced, being ~$2000 in total, but considering how
    much I was being charged per unit (~$1700) at Uni and how this was really a course that was tailored to those even without much 
    knowledge of finance I guess I can let it go. I gave my dad a big hug when I realised how important understanding orderflow 
    was when studying financial markets as that is the literal supply and demand dynamics which I had studided all along in my economics
    courses. I've gone through a bit mmore than half of my work at uni now, graduating in 2024 with my Bachelor's Degree in  
    Ecomomics majoring in Professional Economics and Finance. Now completing my first semester in my Master of Applied Finance program, 
    I'd like to put some money on myself and do my best to figure out some things.
