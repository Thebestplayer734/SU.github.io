  <p>Hey, my name is Suhaas (pronounced <i>'Sou-haas'</i>). Iâ€™m an applied finance and economics student at the University of Western
    Australia and have created this webpage to document my thoughts and projects to anyone interested. 
  
    <br><br>Best Insights: <i>"The distribution of up and down days in the s&p 500 Futures Market, UP days being characterised by 
      a trading day where the market closes higher than it opens and DOWN days being when the close is lower than open, is ~55% up
      , ~45% down over the past 5000 trading days" (had to start somewhere)
