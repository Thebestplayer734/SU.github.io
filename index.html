  <p>Hey, my name is Suhaas (pronounced <i>'Sou-haas'</i>). Iâ€™m an applied finance and economics student at the University of Western
    Australia and have created this webpage to document my thoughts and projects for anyone interested.

  <div class="boxed-text">
    Best Insights: <i>"The distribution of up and down days in the S&P 500 Futures Market (UP days being characterised by 
      a trading day where the market closes higher than it opens and DOWN days being when the close is lower than open) is ~55% up
      , ~45% down over the past 5000 trading days" (had to start somewhere)

    <br>Main Thoughts for This Week:
      <br><br><strong>21 July 2025:</strong>So Far, I've set up a dashboard which I update weekly on Sundays that plots high impact fundamental data releases of various US econoomic metrics including: ISM Manufacturing/Services Purchasing Managers 
    Index, CPI, Unemployment Data, Retail Sales, the 3 different cuts of GDP releases, Housing Data and the Trade Balance. Here comes my first idea: got to look at how the FED is shaping up in the long run (Long Run value) with respect to their
    monetary policy and then using orderflow tools (Short Run value) to enter into bets scaled according to how confident I am with the respective position im taking. This has been the idea that sort of got me hooked. It could yield very high returns with 
    the leverage I have access to (1:30). However, due to my warchest being a bit empty, my starting capital looks like it will be ~$440. This is okay tho because if im trading $1 pts on S&P500 CFD's I only need about ~$300 for one contract and I think
    that will be enough to simulate realistic enough trading conditions. Also less capital means loss's will be minimal. So $440 is enough Just until I understand things a bit better. But enough of that, time to do the research.
    <br> <br> <strong>21 July 2025:</strong>This post marks the exciting beginning to my work in financial data analysis - with equal parts
    optimism and foreboding. Let's see how we do. :)
    <br><br> For any Questions, my best contact email address as - of 19/7/25 is: suhaas734utagi@gmail.com.
