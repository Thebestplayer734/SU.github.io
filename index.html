  <p>Hey, my name is Suhaas (pronounced <i>'Soo-haas'</i>). I’m an applied finance and economics student currently studying at the University of Western
    Australia and have created this webpage to document my thoughts and projects on things I am interested in/enjoy for anyone interested. 
  <br>
  <div class="boxed-text">
    Best Insight: <i> "The distribution of up and down days in the S&P 500 Futures Market (UP days being characterised by 
      a trading day where the market closes higher than it opens and DOWN days being when the close is lower than open) is ~55% up
      , ~45% down over the past 5000 trading days" (had to start somewhere)

    <br>Main Thoughts for This Week: 

     <br> <br> <strong>11 December 2025:</strong> Its now my 22nd Birthday. Strategy isn't good enough. Lost more money recently. Thought I had figured it out but I was mistaken. I have gotten over what was holding me back though
      now so hopefully I can make money on sim over the next month with my new strategy. If I see no substantial progress by the time this months data subscrption runs out, I will be terminating my pursuit of this journey in hopes of a normal job and life and can just 
      call all this a bad dream. 

      <br><br>  So what am I even thinking about? Reading through my earlier posts in July where I laid down the base theory to what im doing, I have deduced that my strategy failed in several key areas. These were identified as: lack of scaling strategies, random entry/exits, identification 
      of market structure, keeping consistent logs of what worked and what didnt, HARDCORE GAMBLING BEHAVIOUR IT WAS DISGUSTING, inconsistent market prep, overtrading during low volume periods and a lack of formalized logic in my strategy. Considering this, I've 
      torn down and redesigned my own framework to do things correctly and be hell pro. 

      <div class="boxed-text">
        <strong> So here are my newest additions:    </strong>
        <br>   - Expanded and personalised market phases framework, from 2 stages in my initial model to 6 stages.
        <br>   - Added intermediary phases that build the 6 stages to add precision (as-well-as a phase that ID's where my trading is weak 
        <br>   - Added mandatory analysis of fundamental data releases (CL - EIA Inventory/OPEC/Geopolotical climate/etc, ES - FOMC/Data Releases/Dealers Gamma/etc)
        <br>   - Added mandatory pre-trading analysis to gauge key levels (VPOC/VWAP-session & wkly/Highs/Lows/SDs/CVA's/other key levels)
        <br>   - Added a scaling framework for different setups during different phases
        <br>   - Added a simple trade tracker to log each trade correctly
      </i>
      </div>
  
      
     
     <br> <br> This basically the way Ive built on the model. 'My strategy' has probably been derived by thousands of humans already but I do still consider it proprietary and so will not be detailing my structure for anyone. However, as the analysis is less proprietary and more-so
     just piecing together the context of the market, I will be uploading my analysis and levels on a consistent basis while i'm studying. Will see what happens now. 
     
     <br> <br> <strong>21 July 2025:</strong> Its almost time now to get back into the markets, I've already done some analysis
      over my coursework at uni, very rudumentary though I have to say. Mainly just watching how the market incorporates new
      information, the way price behaves at critical levels (VWAP/VPOC/SD Bands etc.), some theory on how traders measure their performance, the
      price ladder, my understanding of economics and finance and a touch of ChatGPT (hahahah cant avoid it nowadays, too good at coding). There were some big wins... and big losses... however, I burnt out due to a series 
      of unfortunate events... but Im back for good now. Now this will either go very good and I become a legend, or end as a cautionary tale of the dangers
      of gambling and lost time that I tell colleagues in the future. Whatever it is, I hope I look back one day and appreciate myself for trying something. 

      <br> <br> I've thought about it more clearly now and have decided to share the critical points of my strategy due to my understanding of 
      the fact that this is not a perfectly replicable strategy sent from god (Otherwise i'd sell it for millions), however also knowing its strength if done right. Please note though, it may be equally destructive when done incorrectly and should only be attempted if
      a person has lots of spare time, a healthy mental state and an okay understanding of econ/finance/statistics (pretty much upto the applications of hypo-testing to begin but will need to learn as time passes and stay upto date with advancements). The core idea is 
      to look at how the FED is shaping up in the long run with respect to their monetary policy and then using
      orderflow tools (Short Run value) to scale into bets weighted proportionally to how confident I am with each given position at different points in time.
      I believe there is very real possibility to generate abnormal returns if a quantitative system is made and updated 
      by someone with a good understanding of this stuff to inform that persons day-to-day trading decisions. The key is simply to understand
      everything that matters, how much it matters, what may change that mattering, the effects of any given change and finally reviewing news daily
      so as to update positions with respect to my thoughts. Now it seems complicated but I believe that if I can 
      organise these things, probs diagramatically, after just a few months of practice, depravity commitment, it should just be second nature. 
      But What are these things you may ask? Well its everything isn't it; who is participating, supply/demand of goods/services, elasticity's of 
      various entities, market structure and competition, the integration of markets, trade flows and exchange rates,
      expectations and behaviour, policy and regulation, external shocks like: natural/man-made disasters or technological change, energy prices, orderflow, 
      market micro-structure, curerncy effects, demographics and cultural/sociopolitical factors. Basically everything
      that can affect price can be traced back to some combination of the topics found in these broader factors of econ/finance which I just listed. 
      This is what my research will be based on. This seems to be a sensible approach given what I know about the lack of abnormal returns in financial markets and staggerring loss rate of the retail trading community.
      
      <br> <br>Well after that little intro, I got some things to do for the next couple days but will be back to make a real start :).
      
      <br> <br> <strong>21 July 2025:</strong>This post marks the exciting beginning to my work in financial data analysis - with equal parts
      optimism and foreboding. Let's see how we do. :)
